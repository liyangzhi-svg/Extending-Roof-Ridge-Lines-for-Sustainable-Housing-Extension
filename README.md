Project Summary
To address the challenges of global urbanization and housing shortages, implementing practical densification approaches often necessitates tailoring solutions based on the local context and prevailing housing typologies. However, such expansion strategies have been limited to unidirectional stacking or single-direction extensions while also heavily relying on designers' previous experience and subjective judgment. Therefore, this study proposes a novel machine learning (ML)-based framework for generating multi-directional house extension options, enabling efficient and contextually appropriate residential densification. Unlike existing approaches limited to unidirectional expansion and subjective designer input, our framework automatically identifies suitable land surfaces, conducts voxel-based generation of extensions, and incorporates customizable, structurally valid prefabricated components.
